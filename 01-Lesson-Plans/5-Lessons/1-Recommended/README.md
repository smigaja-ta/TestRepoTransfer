## Module 5: Virtual Class (Recommended) Lesson Plan (2hr)

### Overview

Today's Virtual Class (Recommended) Session is an optional session. Since there is nothing to install this week, use the time to check in with students and address any questions they have about content in the course so far.

Encourage participation by reminding them that this is their time to ask questions and get assistance from their instructional staff as theyâ€™re learning new concepts, so they should take full advantage of the time.

Expect that students may ask for assistance such as the following:

* Further review on a particular subject
* Debugging assistance
* Help with computer issues
* Guidance with a particular tool
