# Module 2: Virtual Class (Recommended) Lesson Plan (2hr)

### Overview 

Today's Virtual Class (Recommended) Session is an optional session to give students an opportunity to work on their assignment with moderate guidance.

In this week's Challenge Assignment, students are asked to refactor code in order to make it more efficient. Since many of our students do not have a background related to coding, the concept of refactoring is still new to them. 

We have explained the concept of refactoring code like rewriting the first draft of an essay. The first time the code is written, our focus is getting it to work correctly. After the first draft is complete, we can look to see how we could accomplish the same task with code that runs more quickly or is easier to understand. 

This is the first time in the course where we’re asking the students to think outside of the box and evaluate their own decisions for improvements. Because this is so new to them, this can seem like a very daunting task. We recommend taking the time to make them more comfortable with the idea of refactoring.

The second hour of Virtual Class (Recommended) Sessions is reserved for an open-ended office hours, driven by students.
